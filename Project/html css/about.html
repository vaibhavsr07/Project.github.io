	<div style="text-align: center; font-size: 25px; margin-top: 196px;">"Sustainability, social equality and the environment are now business problems. And corporate leaders can't depend on governments to solve them."
	<br>Peter Senge, Founder, Society for Organisational Learning</div>

	<div style="margin-top: 70px; height: 50px; width: 1500px; font-size: 18px; text-align :center;">Inspired by Senge's philosophy, a group of young corporate professionals came together to set up Smile Foundation to work with grassroots initiatives for effecting positive changes in the lives of underprivileged children, their families and communities.Children are the future of a nation. For an emerging country like India, development of underprivileged children holds the key to the progress of the nation itself, and their education is the cornerstone of this progress. But education for children cannot be achieved without ensuring the welfare of the family â€“ a child can go to school regularly only when the family, particularly the mother is healthy and empowered; the family has decent livelihood opportunities and a steady income.

	Realizing this, Smile Foundation, beginning in the corridors of education, has adopted a lifecycle approach with intensive programmes focused on family health, livelihood and community engagement through women empowerment, which addresses the needs of less privileged children, their families and the larger community.</div>
