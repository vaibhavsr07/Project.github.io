	<span style="font-family:cursive; color: rgb(255 2 2);"><br>We basically focus on:</span>
	
	<div style="color: rgb(255 2 2);"><br><span style="font-size: 25px; font-family: cursive;">Education:</span>Mission Education, the education programme of Smile Foundation provides basic education and healthcare to underprivileged children, with the belief that education is both the means as well as the end to a better life because it empowers an individual to earn his/her livelihood while also increasing one's awareness on a range of issues; in the process helping him/her evolve as a better citizen.</div>

	<div style="color: rgb(255 2 2);"><br><span style="font-size: 25px; font-family: cursive;">Healthcare:</span>Smile on Wheels is a national level mobile healthcare programme which provides curative and preventive healthcare services at the doorsteps of the underserved in remote rural villages and urban slums, besides inculcating a health-seeking behavior in them, which also includes child health programmes in schools.</div>

	<div style="color: rgb(255 2 2);"><br><span style="font-size: 25px; font-family: cursive;">Livelihood:</span>Smile Twin e-Learning Programme (STeP) evolved as a logical linkage to Mission Education, based on the need to provide employability skills to high school pass-outs and urban underprivileged youth to enhance their prospects of employment in the fast expanding retail, hospitality and service sectors.</div>

	<div style="color: rgb(255 2 2);"><br><span style="font-size: 25px; font-family: cursive;">Women Empowerment:</span>Swabhiman is a programme focusing on girl children and women empowerment. The USP of Swabhiman is its innovative and highly effective approach named the ‘4-S Model’ which means Seeking Healthcare as a Behaviour, Support through Education, Support from Men through Male Involvement, and Sustaining Change in the Community.</div>

	<div style="color: rgb(255 2 2);"><br><span style="font-size: 25px; font-family: cursive;">Empowering Grassroots:</span>The growth of the non-profit sector in India, in the last two decades, has been phenomenal. Grassroots NGOs particularly, by engaging directly with the people, are able to participate in the thought-making process of the communities they work with, and thus have the capacity to bring about long-lasting positive change.</div>

	<div style="color: rgb(255 2 2);"><br><span style="font-size: 25px; font-family: cursive;">Child for Child:</span>Children are the future of a nation. They are the best change agents, be it in the family or the community in which they live. It is therefore crucial to catch them young and inculcate in them feelings of empathy and conscience so that they grow up as responsible individuals.</div>

	<div style="color: rgb(255 2 2);"><br><span style="font-size: 25px; font-family: cursive;">Special Support Programme:</span>Smile Foundation constantly strives to support and empower individuals, particularly underprivileged children enabling them to meet basic ambitions of their life and realize their potential, make informed choices, resist oppression, fight for rightful existence and facilitate new possibilities and opportunities for them.</div>

	<div style="color: rgb(255 2 2);"><br><span style="font-size: 25px; font-family: cursive;">Disaster Response:</span>Being a disaster-prone country, India is highly vulnerable to various types of natural calamities due to its geographical positioning. According to the National Disaster Management Authority, Govt. of India, more than 58.6% of the country’s landmass is prone to earthquakes and over 12% is prone to floods; close to 5,700kms out of the 7,516kms long coastline is prone to cyclones and tsunamis; while 68% of its cultivable area is prone to droughts. Smile Foundation has provided disaster relief in many such disasters.</div>
