	<div style="font-size: 18px; font-family: cursive;">Hetal at a tender age has realized that poverty can come in the way of anyone's dream. Instead of going to school, Hetal makes the rounds of four to five houses each day and takes care of her father, till her mother and elder sister return. Hetal's father has been bedridden for two years now, due to an accident. Since then, life has taken a bitter turn for Hetal. The only respite in Hetal's life comes from her dream of becoming an airhostess when she grows up.
	<br>
	Smile Foundation as an NGO in India has so far directly put more than 200,000 children like Hetal into the path of empowerment through education through its Mission Education programme.
	<br>
	Like Hetal, there are 17 million children in India working as child labour. At least 62% of the total out-of-school children in India are girls. Last year, 51% of the total beneficiaries of Mission Education programme were girls.

	<div><br> <span style="font-size:25px; font-family:cursive;">School and Careers:</span> <span style="font-size:18px; font-family:cursive;">Children are the future of a nation. They are the best change agents, be it in the family or the community in which they live. It is therefore crucial to help the children, catch them young and inculcate in them feelings of empathy and conscience so that they grow up as responsible individuals. Sensing this need, Smile Foundation came up with Child For Child (CFC) programme. Sensitization of privileged children and their parents, towards the existing inequalities around them, is an important objective of CFC.
	<br>
	Privileged children are sensitized about the deprivation and pain endured by the underprivileged kids. CFC seeks to inculcate a conscience and value system in the children so that they grow up to become responsible citizens and change makers. Before their minds are set with age, the CFC programme tries to make them count their own blessings and understand the plight of less privileged ones. Once they start realizing the worth of the privileges they are born with, they automatically turn their thoughts towards positivity and develop the right outlook. This eventually helps them develop into not only successful but responsible individuals in life. They grow up to become significant change makers, who contribute positively to the society.
	<br>
	Under Child For Child programme, Smile Foundation visits various schools and conducts engaging sessions for the young minds. It sensitizes children towards various causes and let them realize their privileged status.
	<br>
	CFC currently reaches out to nearly one million privileged children in 900 schools spread across 417 districts of India, every year. In addition, their parents and teachers are also involved in the process. The programme has today reached out to each part of India with the exception of Lakshadweep </span></div>
